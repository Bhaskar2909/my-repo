## 4 hours of Day 1:
- I have started working on the tasks assigned to me in the jira by the team. One of them was to "Review the proposed UI sketches with client". At the Time of module 1 we have created some UI screens and off them 2 got approval from the client and commented it in jira. and then started working on the other task "design a team creation screen".  I have created a Screen with header as TEAM CREATION and two tabs CREATE TEAM and other JOIN TEAM.The main aim of this page is, as soon as the user login with his credentials, he will be directed to the screen where he can either create a team or join the exsisting team.

## 4 hours of Day 2:
- I have attended the Zoom session along with my teammates, hosted by the User stories and Sprint planning group. In the session, we have shared our ideas on scheduling the Workflow of the project and also discussed the roles of each individual in the group and discussed what to work on.  and then we joined the repository by accepting the invitation link sent by User stories and Sprint planning group.
